"Create Quiz" Route & DB


Modified multi answer so I can retrieve all 3 from each question. Removed unused id's.



from flask import request

@app.route("/create", methods=["GET", "POST"])
@login_required
def create():
    if request.method == "POST":
        # ... existing code ...

        if quiztype == "multi":
            answers = []
            for i in range(amount):
                question_text = request.form.get(f"question{i+1}")
                for j in range(3):  # Assuming there are 3 answer options per question
                    answer_text = request.form.get(f"answer{i+1}_{j+1}")
                    answers.append({"question": question_text, "answer": answer_text})

            # Now 'answers' is a list of dictionaries, each containing the question and its associated answers
            # You can use this data as needed (e.g., store it in the database)

        # ... remaining code ...


<!-- Inside the loop for questions -->
<label class="create-label" for="answer{{ j+1 }}">Answer {{ j+1 }}:</label> 
<input
    name="answer{{ i+1 }}_{{ j+1 }}"
    id="answer{{ j+1 }}"
    class="field"
    type="text"
/>
