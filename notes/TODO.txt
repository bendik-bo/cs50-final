Transaction Management: Currently, your database operations are executed 
independently. It's important to consider wrapping these operations in a 
transaction to ensure data integrity. If one of the insertions fails 
(due to a database error, for instance), you donâ€™t want to have partial data 
inserted. This is especially important when you have related data across 
multiple tables.

Error Handling: It's always a good practice to include error handling 
when interacting with databases to catch any exceptions that might occur 
during the query execution. This helps in gracefully handling errors and 
also in debugging issues related to database operations.
